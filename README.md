# Stroke-Prediction-Analysis
I Analyzed stoke dataset to uncover patterns and risk factors associated with stroke based on demographic and health variables

Tools: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
Skills: Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, EDA, Visualization

## Key Steps
Handled missing values(BMI median imputation)
Converted age to integer & grouped into categories
Created BMI categories for better segmentation
Generated Pivot tables and visualizations 
Built stroke rate metrics and summary statistics

## Insights
Senior age group had the highest stroke rate
Imbalanced stroke disribution shows classification challenge
BMI and glucose levels show noticeable relationship with stroke
Gender and smoking patterns also influence outcomes
